# Overview

This repository contains the sample code that was covered in my talk at the conference [Codemobile 2019](http://www.codemobile.co.uk) (link to video to follow). This repo is an example of how to implement a custom UICollectionViewLayout. This code sample builds up each step towards building a collection view that loops/repeats its content as the user scrolls through it. There's a branch for each step.
